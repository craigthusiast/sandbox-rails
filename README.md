This is my sandbox for learning and experimenting with *Ruby on Rails*.

I'm always keen to connect with other developers, so please connect with / follow me here on Github,
or better yet, let's connect and chat on Twitter! [*@craigthusiast*](http://www.twitter.com/craigthusiast)

If you see anything I should change or improve, please let me know! I'm a code newbie, so I'm all ears!
